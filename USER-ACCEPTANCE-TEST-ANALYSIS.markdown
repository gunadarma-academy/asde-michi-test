This section explains the respondents identity and preference who gave their rating for Arlin website based on their experience when trying some Arlin features. The data collection is done by spreading the online questionnaires to **50 people** via [http://bit.ly/arlinmichi](http://bit.ly/arlinmichi). In this test, respondent identity is classified by gender, city where they lived (limited only to Jabodetabek and Bandung city), age, education, and work field. Also, we ask them about their travelling preference, how often they confused about how to go to their destination, and what they do when they confused.

## Data Analysis
The overall results of the data that filled by **50 respondents** and obtained from the online questionnaire then analyzed and sought the percentage of each question from each questionnaire group. The groups are: **user interface** for question number 1-5, **content** for question number 6-11, **ease of use** for question number 12-16, and **usability** for question number 17-25. The results are shown in the table below.

The calculation are seen from the quantity of answers where the selection of the answers have been adjusted to **Likert Scale** with a scale of 1 (very disagree) to 5 (very agree), then the quantity is converted into percentage form which obtained the following results: 19.5% for the very agree answer (which means, Arlin quality is perfect), 53.9% for the agree answer (which means, Arlin quality is good), 18.9% for the neutral answer (which means, Arlin quality is average), 6.4% for the disagree answer  (which means, Arlin quality is not good), and 1.3% for the very disagree answer  (which means, Arlin quality is far from perfect).

Afterwards, we combine the percentage of the agree and very agree answer into the “good” variable. And also, the percentage of the disagree and very disagree answer into the “not-good” variable. Then, we also separate each questions into its questionnaire group. The table below shows the combination result for each questionnaire groups in each result variables.

From the combination result, as shown in the table above, we’ve got the  percentage for each questionnaire groups in each result variables. The average percentage for all questions is **74.15%** for the good variable, 18.18% for the neutral variable, and 7.67% for the not-good variable. 

The good variable has **74.15%** result. It implies that Arlin website has a good enough quality and has helped people who have transportation problems. For the next development, because there are still 7.67% respondents agreed that Arlin is not good enough and 18.18% respondents are neutral, we will see from which side the Arlin website should be developed. This things can be seen from the percentage on each questionnaire groups. From the neutral variable, the thing that must be improved is the Arlin's content. And also, from the not-good variable, the thing that must be improved is the Arlin's user interface. It is directly proportional to the two lowest percentage in the good variable.
