## Data Analysis
The overall results of the data that filled by **50 respondents** and obtained from the online questionnaire then analyzed and sought the percentage of each question from each questionnaire group. The groups are: **user interface** for question number 1-5, **content** for question number 6-11, **ease of use** for question number 12-16, and **usability** for question number 17-25. The results are shown in the table below.

![data-analysis-uat](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4652284/14762705/90b0e3b6-09ab-11e6-8bee-d61c2853a3c7.png)

The calculation are seen from the quantity of answers where the selection of the answers have been adjusted to **Likert Scale** with a scale of 1 (very disagree) to 5 (very agree), then the quantity is converted into percentage form which obtained the following results: 19.5% for the very agree answer (which means, Arlin quality is perfect), 53.9% for the agree answer (which means, Arlin quality is good), 18.9% for the neutral answer (which means, Arlin quality is average), 6.4% for the disagree answer  (which means, Arlin quality is not good), and 1.3% for the very disagree answer  (which means, Arlin quality is far from perfect).

Afterwards, we combine the percentage of the agree and very agree answer into the `good` variable. And also, the percentage of the disagree and very disagree answer into the `not-good` variable. Then, we also separate each questions into its questionnaire group. The table below shows the combination result for each questionnaire groups in each result variables.

![data-result](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4652284/14762717/e44b888c-09ab-11e6-8493-66d994cff855.png)

From the combination result, as shown in the table above, weâ€™ve got the  percentage for each questionnaire groups in each result variables. The average percentage for all questions is **74.15%** for the `good` variable, 18.18% for the `neutral` variable, and 7.67% for the `not-good` variable. 

The good variable has **74.15%** result. It implies that Arlin website has a good enough quality and has helped people who have transportation problems. For the next development, because there are still 7.67% respondents agreed that Arlin is not good enough and 18.18% respondents are neutral, we will see from which side the Arlin website should be developed. This things can be seen from the percentage on each questionnaire groups. From the `neutral` variable, the thing that must be improved is the Arlin's content. And also, from the `not-good` variable, the thing that must be improved is the Arlin's user interface. It is directly proportional to the two lowest percentage in the `good` variable.
