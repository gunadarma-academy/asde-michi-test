# Testing Plan for Arlin by Michi Team

Testing plan for Arlin app by Michi team in ASDE course. All documents are created using Markdown, and could be converted into PDF. Use [`pandoc`](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc) to convert files from one markup format into another.
The slide repo contains SVG, PNG, PDF and fonts for the slide. Slides are created with Inkscape then exported to SVG assets, then could be batch exported to several PNG files, converted to a single PDF.

This relates to [issue #2](https://github.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi/issues/2) and [issue #32](https://github.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi/issues/32) in the [parent repo of ASDE Michi](https://github.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi).

Most of the deatils are also described in [PROJECT-MANAGEMENT](https://github.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi/blob/master/docs/project-management.markdown).
