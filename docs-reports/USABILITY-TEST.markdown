Usability Test
==============

## Description
Usability testing refers to evaluating a product or service by testing it with representative users. Typically, during a test, participants will try to complete typical tasks while observers watch, listen and takes notes.  The goal is to identify any usability problems, collect qualitative and quantitative data and determine the participant's satisfaction with the product. There are several benefits of conducting usability test. Here are the example:

- To learn if participants are able to complete specified tasks successfully and
- To Identify how long it takes to complete specified tasks
- To find out how satisfied participants are with your Web site or other product
- To tdentify changes required to improve user performance and satisfaction
- To analyze the performance to see if it meets your usability objectives

One of the first steps in each round of usability testing is to develop a plan for the test. The purpose of the plan is to document what we are going to do, how we are going to conduct the test, what metrics we are going to capture, number of participants we are going to test, and what scenarios we will use.

## Test Scenario Plan
In this version of Arlin by Michi, we will conduct a test scenario based on the main feature list ([see](https://github.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi-test/tree/master/features)) of Arlin. Here are several features that should be tested on the participant:
- User ability to sign in and sign up
- User ability to post a question
- User ability to answer and reply
- User ability regarding search and label features

A more detailed version of the scenario will be available on the final report template.

## Participant Recruitement Plan
On usability testing, we will conduct the test on several participant with a variety of backgrounds. The most prominent factor to be tested is whether or not the participant have a technological background. We will recruit at least two participants and we're looking to diverse the participant as much as possible.

A more detailed version of the scenario will be available on the final report template.

## Test Procedure Plan
As we mentioned in the post above, the test will be conducted as a simple two-way conversation/dialog. The
participant try to access the Arlin website and complete several tasks scenario while the observer watch, listen and take notes. The participant will be notified by a consent that the activity will be voice-recorded for the purpose of the test. Each test will be last for around 15-20 minutes.
