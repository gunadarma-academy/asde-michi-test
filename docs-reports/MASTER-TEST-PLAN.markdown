Adapted from [Master Test Plan (v061111) by Northwestern University Information Technology (in DOCX format)](http://www.it.northwestern.edu/bin/docs/project-framework/Master_Test_Plan_v061111.docx).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Instruction

This document is used to define the details of the master test plan. Once the test plan is outlined, the document must be reviewed and approved by the lead technical representative on the project as well as the lead business representative on the project.  If anything related to the test plan changes during the execution and testing phase of the project, this document should be updated and re-approved by both parties.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Test Scope

This test plan will test all the requirements for Arlin version 1.0 and beyond (>=2.0), which will be tested by the Michi team for evaluate and verify that the product (Arlin) meet the functional, performance and design. This Master Test Plan covers unit, functional, integration, end-to-end (E2E), usability, and user acceptance test.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Test Inputs/Outputs

The supposed inputs/outputs (I/O) that will be used to assist with the testing effort and a list of the outputs that will be delivered from the testing effort; are all in the feature files using Gherkin syntax. [See them here](https://github.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi-test/tree/master/features).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Test Strategy

### Unit Testing

A unit test is a quality measurement and evaluation procedure applied in most enterprise software development activities. Generally, a unit test evaluates how software code complies with the overall objective of the software/application/program and how its fitness affects other smaller units. Unit tests may be performed manually - by one or more developer - or through an automated software solution.

When tested, each unit is isolated from the primary program or interface. Unit tests are typically performed after development and prior to publishing, thus facilitating integration and early problem detection. The size or scope of a unit varies by programming language, software application, and testing objectives. In this particular project, they're coupled together and can be run asynchronously. Using [Mocha](http://mochajs.org) test framework with the help of [Chai](http://chaijs.com) assertion library, we can treat them as a test suite.

### Functional Testing

Functional testing is primarily is used to verify that a piece of software is providing the same output as required by the end-user or business. Typically, functional testing involves evaluating and comparing each software function with the business requirements. The software is tested by providing it with some related input so that the output can be evaluated to see how it conforms, relates or varies compared to its base requirements. Moreover, functional testing also checks the software for usability, such as by ensuring that the navigational functions are working as required. We can say that functional tests could contain many unit tests. If possible we're also using test runner like [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) along with [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) module bundler and [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io).

### Continous Integration (CI) Build and Test

Integration testing itself is a software testing methodology used to test individual software components or units of code to verify the interaction between various software components and detect interface defects. Components are tested as a single group or organized in an iterative manner. While the practice of CI (build and test) in software engineering, is merging all developer working copies with a shared mainline several times a day, mostly automated by CI server. We're using [Snap CI](https://snap-ci.com) as our main CI/CD server or provider. Currently the pipelines (development, staging, production) are shown here:

- <https://snap-ci.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi-backend>
- <https://snap-ci.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi-frontend>
- <https://snap-ci.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi-test>

### End-to-End (E2E) Test

End-to-End testing is a technique used to test whether the flow of an application right from start to finish is behaving as expected. The purpose of performing end-to-end testing is to identify system dependencies and to ensure that the data integrity is maintained between various system components and systems. The entire application is tested for critical functionalities such as communicating with the other systems, interfaces, database, network, and other applications. Within the [`test`](https://github.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi-test) repo, we're running the feature files (along with their step definitions) to run our E2E test. The testing flow itself is [in its own section](https://github.com/gunadarma-academy/asde-michi-test#testing-flow). The main test language is using [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference) (specified by [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io)), that can also be used for usability testing.

### Usability Test

> This should be done as a complement to the main user acceptance test

Usability testing refers to evaluating a product or service by testing it with representative users. Typically, during a test, participants will try to complete typical tasks while observers watch, listen and takes notes.  The goal is to identify any usability problems, collect qualitative and quantitative data and determine the participant's satisfaction with the product.

### User Acceptance Test

User acceptance testing (UAT) is a test conducted to determine if the requirements of a specification or to verify if specific requirements are working for the user. User acceptance tests are useful because they capture user requirements in a directly verifiable way, identify problems which unit or integration tests might have missed, and provide an overview of how “done” the system is. UAT typically performed by Regular User, this tests all changed functionality of a system from the end-user perspective. Particularly, we're interviewing user and getting their responses to improve our application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Test Environment (tools, system, databases)

This is a quick list of the testing tools, systems, and databases.

### List of Technologies

Tools:
- Git
- pm2
- Webpack
- Mocha.js, Chai.js, Jasmine, Karma, Cucumber.js
  - [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference): Gherkin is plain-text English (or one of 60+ other languages) with a little extra structure. Gherkin is designed to be easy to learn by non-programmers, yet structured enough to allow concise description of examples to illustrate business rules in most real-world domains.

System:
- Personal Laptop
- Personal Phone
- DigitalOcean VPS
- Snap CI

Database:
- Mock database with in-memory, NeDB, or MongoDB.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Bug Tracking/Process/Resolution

> We haven't got any reproducable/in-depth bug report from external party yet. So this process is not yet executable.

During testing, the testing team members normally encounter behavior that goes against a specified or implied design requirement in the product.  When this happens, we will document and reproduce the bugs for the developers.

Expectation of a bug:

- Keep track of what version of the application the bug is found
- Determine if bug has already been written up
- Indicate the steps to reproduce the bug – write enough details for others looking at the bug to be able to duplicate it; exclude unnecessary steps (i.e. If access point is irrelevant, be more general in your steps).
- Actual results – be specific on your findings.
- Expected results – how the product should behave based on the specified or implied requirements.
- Implications – How does the defect affect the quality of the product?

### Impact and Definitions

The following detail defines the impact levels to be used when entering bugs.

1. Fatal - Test Stopper: If you can’t access a function and need the bug to be fixed immediately.  The defect prevents QA from testing the feature area, sub-area or functionality of the feature.
2. Serious - Beta Stopper: This is a bug that users would experience such as: data corruption, calculation errors, incorrect data, UE’s and system crash on common user scenarios, significant QA risk, and major UI defects.
3. Minor - Live Release: A bug that must be fixed before the product is officially completed, UE’s or crashes, content, and UI and graphic changes required for release.

### Various Common Roles in Bug Resolution

- Author – The person who wrote the bug; this will be someone on the QA team
- Resolver – Normally an Engineer assigned to a specific area of the application.
- Verifier – normally a QA Engineer responsible for testing the fix and closing the bug.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
