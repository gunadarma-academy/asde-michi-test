User Acceptance Test
============================
## Description 
User Acceptance Testing is, basically, the process of verifying that Arlin (alpha and beta version) works for the user. An acceptance test can be understood as a way to check if a previously defined application system between the developer and the user is still on track. Running those acceptance tests also ensures that no requirement change has happened in the meantime and that everything is as it should be to satisfy the user.

We use alpha and beta testing as a type of user acceptance testing. Alpha testing normally takes place in the development environment and is usually done by internal member – long before the application is even released to external testers or users. Alpha testing can also be done by potential user groups, but the important thing here is that it takes place in the development environment. The feedback – collected from the alpha testers – is then used to fix certain issues or bugs and improve the usability of the product.

Beta testing, also known as "field testing", takes place in the user’s environment and involves some extensive testing by a group of users who use the system in their environment. These beta testers then provide feedback, which in turn leads to improvements of the product.

To perform this testing, we spread out statement questionnaires about user satisfaction to several respondents via Typeform online form.

## Likert Scale

A Likert scale is a psychometric scale commonly involved in research employing questionnaires. Likert developed the principle of measuring attitudes by asking people to respond to a series of statements about a topic, in terms of the extent to which they agree with them, and so tapping into the cognitive and affective components of attitudes. Self-reporting is the most widely used approach to scaling responses in survey research. Likert-type or frequency scales use fixed choice response formats and are designed to measure attitudes or opinions. These ordinal scales measure levels of agreement/disagreement.  Respondents may be offered a choice of five to seven or even nine pre-coded responses with the neutral point being neither agree nor disagree. In it final form, the Likert Scale is a five (or seven) point scale which is used to allow the individual to express how much they agree or disagree with a particular statement.  

We use likert scale in our questionnaires, we chose five point scale because based on empirical study, five point scale is used frequently and may produce slightly higher mean scores relative to the highest possible attainable score, compared to those produced from the use of other levels, and this difference was statistically significant.

Five point scale: Very Agree, Agree, Netral, Disagree, Very Disagree.
