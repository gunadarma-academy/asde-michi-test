User Acceptance Test
============================
## Description 
User Acceptance Testing is, basically, the process of verifying that Arlin (alpha and beta version) works for the user. An acceptance test can be understood as a way to check if a previously defined application system between the developer and the user is still on track. Running those acceptance tests also ensures that no requirement change has happened in the meantime and that everything is as it should be to satisfy the user.

We use alpha and beta testing as a type of user acceptance testing. Alpha testing normally takes place in the development environment and is usually done by internal member – long before the application is even released to external testers or users. Alpha testing can also be done by potential user groups, but the important thing here is that it takes place in the development environment. The feedback – collected from the alpha testers – is then used to fix certain issues or bugs and improve the usability of the product.

Beta testing, also known as "field testing", takes place in the user’s environment and involves some extensive testing by a group of users who use the system in their environment. These beta testers then provide feedback, which in turn leads to improvements of the product.

To perform this testing, we spread out statement questionnaires about user satisfaction to several respondents via Typeform online form.
